# work-day-planner

Here is a work day planner

It displays the date at the top of the page 

It can take in "tasks" for the day during business hours 

It will display red if the hour has passed, it will display green for the current hour, and it will display light blue for future hours

Items are stored in local storage and will continue to be displayed for the assigned hour until removed from local storage.
